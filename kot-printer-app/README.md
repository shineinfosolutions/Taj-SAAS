# Taj Restaurant & Cafe KOT Printer Agent

Local tray app for Windows. Polls the Taj Restaurant & Cafe server for unprinted KOTs and
sends them to a thermal printer over **WiFi / Ethernet (LAN)** or **USB**. Runs
in the system tray, auto-starts on boot, and **auto-detects the printer** — near
zero configuration for the restaurant. Built for the **TVS Champ RP STAR**
(ESC/POS); works with any ESC/POS receipt printer.

This folder is **not** part of the Next.js app and is excluded from Vercel
deploys (`.vercelignore`). It runs on a PC inside the restaurant network.

---

## How it works

```
Vercel (cloud)                    Restaurant PC (this app)        Printer
GET  /api/orders/print-queue  ──►  poll every ~4s
                                   build ESC/POS  ──────────────►  print
PATCH /api/orders/:id/mark-printed ◄── mark done
```

The server cannot reach a printer on `192.168.x.x`, so this agent bridges it.

**Server URL and auth token are baked into the build** (`config.js`) — the
restaurant operator never sees or types them. The only thing they may touch is
which printer to use, and even that is auto-detected.

---

## 1. One-time build setup (developer)

The agent authenticates to the server with a token. This is **not** a per-device
step — it is embedded once at build time and hidden from the UI.

> Why a token at all: `/api/orders/print-queue` returns live order data (tables,
> items, totals). A fully open endpoint would leak every order. The agent still
> authenticates; the secret is just invisible to the operator.

1. Server: set `PRINT_AGENT_SECRET=<long-random>` in `.env.local` **and** the
   Vercel project env. Generate one:
   ```powershell
   [Convert]::ToBase64String((1..32 | % { Get-Random -Max 256 }))
   ```
2. Agent: put the **same** value into the build, either by editing
   `AGENT_TOKEN` in `kot-printer-app/config.js`, or by setting the
   `KOT_AGENT_TOKEN` env var before building. `SERVER_URL` is already hardcoded
   to `https://taj-saas.vercel.app`.

> Note: an embedded token in a desktop app can be extracted by someone with the
> installer. That is acceptable for order data. The fully-secure future option
> is per-device pairing (agent registers, admin approves, server issues a scoped
> token) — see the "Future" note at the bottom.

## 2. Install & run (restaurant PC)

```bash
cd kot-printer-app
npm install
npm start
```

On first launch the agent **automatically scans the network** (mDNS + a port-9100
sweep) and the USB printers:

- **Exactly one printer found** → it is selected automatically and printing
  starts. Nothing to configure.
- **Multiple / none** → Settings opens so you can pick. The list auto-populates.

The tray dot is **green** when healthy, **red** on error (hover for the reason).
Right-click the tray for **Find printer**, **Test Print**, **Print Now**,
**Settings**, **Quit**.

## 3. Printer wiring

### WiFi or Ethernet (recommended — no native module)

A WiFi printer and an Ethernet printer look identical to the agent: both get a
LAN IP and listen on port **9100**.

- **Ethernet:** LAN cable into the printer's `E` port → router/switch.
- **WiFi:** join the printer to the restaurant WiFi (per its manual).

Then just open the app — auto-detect finds it. If your printer supports mDNS it
appears instantly; otherwise the port-9100 sweep finds it within a few seconds.

> Tip: reserve the printer's IP in the router (DHCP reservation by MAC). Even if
> you don't, the agent **self-heals**: if the printer stops responding it
> re-scans and adopts the new IP automatically.

### USB

USB printing needs a native module; WiFi/Ethernet does not. Prefer network unless
the printer must be cabled to this PC.

1. Install the TVS driver so the printer appears as a named Windows printer.
2. Add the native driver and build it against Electron's ABI:
   ```bash
   npm install @thiagoelg/node-printer --ignore-scripts
   npm run rebuild-usb
   ```
   **`--ignore-scripts` matters:** the driver is an `optionalDependency`. On a
   newer system Node (e.g. v24) the install-time native build can fail, and npm
   then *silently drops* the optional package — so it never reaches the build.
   `--ignore-scripts` skips that throwaway system-node build; `rebuild-usb`
   (electron-rebuild) then compiles the `.node` against Electron, which is the
   only ABI that matters at runtime.

   Requires Visual Studio Build Tools with the "Desktop development with C++"
   workload + Python. The old `printer` package is abandoned and won't build on
   Electron 31 — use `@thiagoelg/node-printer`.

   Verify it loaded (lists your Windows printers):
   ```bash
   node_modules/.bin/electron -e "const{app}=require('electron');app.whenReady().then(()=>{console.log(require('@thiagoelg/node-printer').getPrinters().map(p=>p.name));app.quit()})"
   ```
3. Settings → USB → Scan → pick the printer. Save → Test Print.

## 4. Build an installer (.exe)

```bash
# make sure the token is set first (config.js or KOT_AGENT_TOKEN)
npm run dist
```
Output in `dist/`. Run the NSIS installer on the restaurant PC. The app
self-registers for auto-start on boot (toggle in Settings → Advanced).

## Behaviour notes

- **Auto-detect:** mDNS (`_pdl-datastream._tcp`, `_printer._tcp`) + a port-9100
  subnet sweep, unioned. Single obvious match is selected automatically.
- **Self-heal:** after repeated print failures on a network printer, the agent
  re-scans and adopts a new reachable IP (handles DHCP changes).
- **Dedup:** each KOT prints once (in-memory set + the server's `kotPrinted`
  flag). If `mark-printed` fails, the in-memory set still prevents a reprint this
  session; the server retries next poll.
- **Safety window:** the queue only returns KOTs from the last 4 hours, so a
  long-offline agent won't dump a whole day of stale tickets on reconnect.

## Future

- **Per-device pairing** instead of a baked token: the agent generates a keypair
  on first run, registers with the server, an admin approves it in the dashboard,
  and the server issues a revocable per-device token. Removes the
  extractable-shared-secret risk.
- **Reprint button** on the KDS card (clears `kotPrinted` → re-queues).
- **Multiple printers** (bar + kitchen): run two instances, or route by item
  category in `poll()`.
